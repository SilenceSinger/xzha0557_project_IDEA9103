**Chosing Audio Method in the individual work**

# Reference of the audio file: 
[The Great Gig in the Sky](https://open.spotify.com/track/0pa1qPQkefm7LzsLEjG00L?si=KrZi5fFQT9GMWFwUpLHP8g)

# Changes from the Group Code: 
1. Collect the rain ellipses into an array for easier adjustment behind; 
2. Connect the audio file to the random changes of rains, changing the positions and speed of rain depending on audio amplitude and frequency.
3. Create specific functions for individual work completion.

# Animation:
The rain sets are designed by 800 ellipses with narrow width. 
For clean and proper visualization, translate() function has been employed to move the original ellipses outside the image, therefore only animated rains could be seen on canvas.
